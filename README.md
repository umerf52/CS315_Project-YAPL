# YAPL - Yet Another Programming Language
This is an implementation of an interpreter that interprets my home-made programming language.   
Some examples of syntax of this programming language are availble in _CS 315 - Project Statement 2020.pdf_ and _\\test\_cases_.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7.7
- [PLY](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/) 3.11

## How to run
`python interpreter.py test_case_file`   
test_case_file can be any file from the directory _\\test\_cases_.

## Implementation
I implemented the following tasks:
- Compulsory (Easy)
- Do-While Loops (Medium)
- Structs (Hard)
